**Adobe Scams (Real):**

FTC sued 2024: Hidden annual fees in "monthly" trials, cancellation maze.
Early cancel fee: Up to 50% of remaining contract (~$120+).
Users hit with $52.99/mo auto-bills post-trial; chat support ghosts.
2024 TOS uproar: Vague AI training access → lawsuits, boycotts.

Transparency (Mixed):

Wins: CAI for AI watermarks, licensed Firefly data, CDP "A List" 8 yrs.
Fails: TOS backlash, dark UX patterns, trust eroded.

Open-Source Escape:
GIMP/Inkscape/Krita (free Photoshop rivals).
DaVinci Resolve: Free tier > Premiere; one-time $299 pro.

FTC = Federal Trade Commission
U.S. government agency that protects consumers from unfair/deceptive business practices.
Sued Adobe in 2024 over hidden subscription fees & cancellation traps.

- **FTC = Federal Trade Commission** (U.S. agency, est. 1914)  
  - **Core Role**: Enforces consumer protection laws; fights **unfair, deceptive, or anticompetitive** acts in commerce (Section 5, FTC Act).  
  - **In Tech**: No direct rule-making power like EU’s GDPR, but uses **enforcement + lawsuits** to shape behavior.
